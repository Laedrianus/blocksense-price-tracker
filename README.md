# üß† Blocksense Price Tracker & Simulate Your Own Feed

A lightweight educational dApp demonstrating how **peg-aware oracles** can improve reliability in DeFi pricing ‚Äî built as part of the **Blocksense** ecosystem.

> This project simulates the concept of peg-aware feeds using real-time data from [CoinGecko](https://coingecko.com), until official Blocksense endpoints become publicly available.

## üîç What is Blocksense?

Blocksense is a decentralized oracle network that enables secure, reliable, and peg-aware data feeds for smart contracts. It ensures data accuracy and consistency across chains, helping prevent price manipulation and depeg incidents. Blocksense supports modular oracle architecture, on-chain consensus, and real-time reporting.

What is this Dapp?

üß™ Simulate Your Own Feed
The "Simulate Your Own Feed" page (CustomFeedCreator.tsx) provides users with a dummy interface to understand how the Blocksense oracle infrastructure works. While no real data is transmitted on-chain, the page simulates the process of creating a price feed in an interactive and visual way.

üîß What Can Users Do on This Page?
Enter a Token Name and Symbol (e.g., ‚ÄúMy USD‚Äù - MYUSD)

Select a base token whose real-time price is fetched from CoinGecko (e.g., USDC, DAI)

Input a Custom Price for their own simulated feed (e.g., 1.05)

Click Submit, and the following happens:

‚úÖ The inputted data is added to a dynamic table

‚úÖ The simulated feed is displayed as if it were submitted to the Blocksense oracle system

‚úÖ A "Depegged?" check compares the custom price to the live reference price and evaluates its peg status

‚öôÔ∏è Technical Overview
We use a custom hook (useCoingecko.ts) to fetch real-time token prices

The user-defined price is compared with the live price

The result is rendered as a mock feed entry in the UI

No actual on-chain transactions occur ‚Äî this is purely a front-end simulation

üéØ Purpose of This Feature
To demonstrate the core principles behind Blocksense‚Äôs peg-aware oracle design

To provide a testable demo interface before real integrations are implemented

To lay the groundwork for future testnet deployments and developer onboarding

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18
- Git
- (Optional) Vercel CLI

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Laedrianus/blocksense-price-tracker.git
cd blocksense-price-tracker

2. Install Dependencies
npm install

3. Start Development Server
npm run dev

Visit http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

4. Build for Production
npm run build

Deploy
You can deploy this project on Vercel (recommended):

Go to vercel.com
Connect your GitHub repo
Set the root directory if needed (e.g. /)
Click Deploy

‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitations
üîê Blocksense oracle API is not yet publicly accessible.
Currently, price data is fetched via the CoinGecko API.
ü§ñ The "Custom Feed Creator" page simulates feed logic but does not submit to a real oracle network yet.
These will be replaced with actual Blocksense endpoints once available.

Future Plans
Replace CoinGecko with native Blocksense endpoints
Add real-time depeg alerts using oracle triggers
Allow users to publish custom feeds to testnets
Extend UI to show trust levels and consensus states

üìÑ License
